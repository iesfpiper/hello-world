My hello world repository
I'm a computer science student in my fourth year of study.  I have been writing scripts since I was in grade six.  When I was in grade seven I wrote a windows command line script to hack other student's computer shares stored on the school's server.  I then went on to write a script that my classmates could use to instant message each other using net message.  

It went on more and more.  By the time I was in my high-school java programming class and found the projects easy to complete well before the deadline, I used my wealth of free time to write scripts that would perform an action on a defined series of computers in my high school.  I'd do things like put every computer in a room into standby sequentially.  Sometimes it entertained me to open up calculator on every computer in the library and then freeze calculator so nobody could close it for 5 minutes.  haha, what fun
